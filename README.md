## What is HalfGammon?
Half Gammon is a simplified version of Backgammon, where the goal is to get all your checkers all the way around and then off the board. You do this by taking turns rolling the dice and moving your checker based on that dice value. If you land on a space that has only one of your opponent's checkers, you can send it back to the beginning in an action called "bumping". If you land on a spot that has two or more of your opponent's checkers, you are blocked, and your turn ends.
